# Programming a golden spiral

About 10 years ago or so, my dad asked me to make a little program to chart a spiral. Not just any spiral, a golden spiral. If you are not familiar with what a golden spiral is, you can read a bit more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_spiral. Basically, a golden spiral is a logarithmic spiral that grows at a factor of 1.618. I wrote the program in about a weekend and he has been using it ever since.

Recently my dad asked me to make some updates to it so that he could license the use of the program to other users. The program was originally written in C# and ran on Windows. Rather than making changes to the original program, I thought it would be better to make a brand new version of it for the web. I had been tinkering with Typescript, so I thought this would be a good opportunity to further improve my Typescript skills.

For the last 10 years I had been developing in straight C. All software I developed was for safety critical applications (more on that some other time) and that meant that I could not even use third party libraries or any sort of advance or obscure feature of the language. As you can imagine, jumping to Typescript has been interesting. Now, the concepts are not new, after all I did object oriented programming in C# before and I always borrowed OOP principles in my C programming.
